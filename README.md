# ISC — Internet Semantic Chat

> **Open a tab. Type what you're thinking about. Meet the people closest to your current thought, anywhere on earth.**

No account. No download. No algorithm selecting who you see.

ISC is a fully decentralized platform that runs an AI language model entirely inside your browser, places your thoughts in a shared semantic space, and connects you with people thinking nearest to you — anywhere in the network, in real time.

The layout is the algorithm. There is no feed ranked by engagement, no follower graph curated by a corporation. Just you, your thoughts, and everyone else who happens to be thinking nearby.

---

## Why This Matters

Every existing platform routes information by social graph (who you follow), engagement signal (what gets clicks), or algorithmic recommendation (what the platform wants you to see). None of them route by *meaning*.

ISC routes by semantic proximity. A flood relief coordinator in Lagos and a logistics engineer in Berlin may have never heard of each other — but if they both describe what they're working on during a crisis, ISC finds them within minutes. Not because an algorithm matched their profiles. Because their thoughts landed in the same neighborhood.

This works for coordination across disciplines — a biologist studying network resilience and a city planner studying transit failure share more semantic common ground than either realizes, but would never find each other on any existing platform. It works across languages — the multilingual embedding model finds meaning-proximity regardless of which language you wrote in. It recreates the serendipitous intellectual encounters that used to require being at the right conference at the right time.

No server sees your ideas. No company decides who you meet. The network organizes itself by meaning.

---

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node 18+, pnpm 8+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/isc.git
cd isc && pnpm install
```

### Web App _(primary)_

```bash
cd apps/browser && pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

Type what you're thinking about. The embedding model loads once (~22 MB, cached locally afterward). Your position in semantic space is announced to the peer network. Matches appear as real people arrive with overlapping thoughts. Click any match to open an end-to-end encrypted conversation — no server involved, no message ever leaves your browser unencrypted.

To deploy publicly, serve the production build from any static host:

```bash
cd apps/browser && pnpm build
# Serve the dist/ directory with any static file server
```

### Terminal UI

For servers, SSH sessions, or anyone who prefers the terminal:

```bash
cd apps/tui && pnpm start
```

Three-pane layout: channels on the left, conversations in the center, nearby peers on the right. Navigate with arrow keys or `j`/`k`. Same semantic matching as the browser app, no browser required.

### Relay Node (required for cross-browser messaging)

**Single-browser use:** Works standalone — no relay required.

**Cross-browser messaging:** At least one relay node must be reachable so browsers can find each other on the network.

#### Local development

Run the local relay alongside the browser app:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — browser dev server
pnpm dev:browser

# Terminal 2 — local relay (libp2p on :9000, admin on :9091)
pnpm dev:relay
```

The browser app automatically bootstraps from `localhost:9000` in development mode.

#### Production / Community Relay

```bash
# With Docker (recommended)
docker compose -f apps/node/docker-compose.yml up

# Or run directly
cd apps/node && pnpm start
```

Admin dashboard at `http://localhost:9091`. Health check: `GET /health`. Prometheus metrics: `GET /metrics`.

Public relay addresses belong in production configuration. The more institutions and individuals run relay nodes, the more resilient and decentralized the semantic web becomes.

## Core Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Fully browser-native** | Minimal server-side compute; all embedding and routing runs in-browser |
| **Serverless P2P** | Kademlia DHT for discovery, WebRTC DataChannels for chat |
| **Channels** | Multiple named presence contexts with optional relational semantics |
| **Adaptive by device** | Model size, worker concurrency, and matching depth auto-scale to device capability |
| **Fuzzy identity** | Users represented as distributions in embedding space, not fixed points |
| **Relational hypergraph** | Optional relation tags compose subjects with context into unified embedding manifolds |
| **Ephemeral by default** | Announcements expire (TTL-based); no persistent profile |
| **E2E encrypted** | WebRTC DTLS + keypair signing secures all streams |

---

## How It Works

### 1. Describe Your Thoughts

Create a channel with a description of what you're thinking about:

> "Distributed systems, consensus algorithms, and the CAP theorem"

### 2. Embedding Computed Locally

Your browser runs an LLM embedding model (4-22 MB depending on device tier) to produce a 384-dimensional vector representing your thoughts.

### 3. Announce to DHT

The vector is hashed via Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and announced to the Kademlia DHT with a tier-dependent TTL.

### 4. Discover Proximal Peers

Your client queries the DHT for candidates with similar LSH keys, then refines matches locally using cosine similarity.

### 5. Form Chats

Click a match to open a 1:1 WebRTC chat. Dense clusters can auto-form group chats.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Channel: "AI Ethics"                                  │
│  Description: "Ethical implications of machine learning"    │
│                                                             │
│  Matches Found:                                             │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ ● Peer QmX...  (0.87 similarity)  [Dial] [Profile]   │  │
│  │ ○ Peer QmY...  (0.79 similarity)  [Dial] [Profile]   │  │
│  │ ○ Peer QmZ...  (0.72 similarity)  [Dial] [Profile]   │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## System Architecture

### Peer Initialization

When a user loads the app:

1. **Capability probe** → selects device tier (High/Mid/Low/Minimal)
2. **Keypair generation** → ed25519 via Web Crypto API for signing
3. **Model loading** → appropriate embedding model cached in IndexedDB
4. **Channel restoration** → saved channels loaded from localStorage
5. **Libp2p node startup** → connects to bootstrap peers

### Channels & Distributions

A **channel** is a named presence context representing current thoughts:

```json
{
  "id": "ch_ai_ethics_9b2f",
  "name": "AI Ethics",
  "description": "Ethical implications of machine learning and autonomy",
  "spread": 0.15,
  "relations": [
    { "tag": "in_location", "object": "lat:35.6895, long:139.6917, radius:50km", "weight": 1.2 },
    { "tag": "during_time", "object": "start:2026-01-01T00:00:00Z, end:2026-12-31T23:59:59Z" },
    { "tag": "with_mood", "object": "reflective and cautious" }
  ]
}
```

Each channel produces a set of **distributions**:

- **Root distribution**: `Embed(description)` → μ_root, σ = channel.spread
- **Fused distributions**: For each relation, `Embed("description tag object")` → μ_fused, σ_fused

### DHT Announcement

Vectors are mapped to DHT keys via **seeded Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** using the embedding model hash to ensure global semantic routing. See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md#lsh-locality-sensitive-hashing) for the complete LSH specification.

Announcement payload:

```json
{
  "peerID": "12D3KooW...",
  "channelID": "ch_ai_ethics_9b2f",
  "model": "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "vec": [0.12, -0.07, ...],
  "relTag": "in_location",
  "ttl": 300,
  "signature": "ed25519_signature"
}
```

### Querying for Proximals

Clients query DHT for candidates with matching LSH keys within the same model's embedding space, then refine locally:

```javascript
const candidates = [];
for (const key of lshHash(currentSample, modelHash, TIER.numHashes)) {
  const values = await node.contentRouting.getMany(key, { count: TIER.candidateCap });
  for (const v of values) {
    const peer = JSON.parse(v);
    if (peer.peerID === node.peerId.toString()) continue;
    if (peer.model !== LOCAL_MODEL) continue;
    if (!verifySignature(peer)) continue;
    candidates.push(peer);
  }
}
```

Candidates are ranked by relational similarity (filtered out by default below 0.55), top-k displayed.

### Forming Chats

Top matches are dialed directly over **WebRTC** via libp2p protocol `/isc/chat/1.0`:

```javascript
const stream = await node.dialProtocol(peerID, '/isc/chat/1.0');
stream.write(JSON.stringify({
  channelID: channel.id,
  msg: 'Hey, our thoughts are proximal!',
}));
```

**Group chats**: 3+ peers matching within same channel form a mesh; rooms identified by hashing the group's shared vector centroid.

### Handling Dynamics

| Challenge | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Peer churn** | DHT naturally handles leaves; heartbeat pings every 30s |
| **Cold start** | Bootstrap via public libp2p relays; "seed tab" pattern |
| **Scale (1k+ peers)** | LSH + DHT approximates well; gossip for >10k |
| **Thought drift** | Edit channel → new embedding pushed to DHT within seconds |
| **NAT traversal** | Public STUN/TURN servers; libp2p circuit relays for hard NATs |
| **Model fragmentation** | `model` field in payload; clients discard mismatched candidates |

---

## Deployment Modes

ISC supports progressive decentralization:

| Mode | Phase | Use Case | Trust Assumptions |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Trusted Network** | Phase 1 | Private communities, invite-only groups | Pre-existing social trust |
| **Federated Networks** | Phase 2 | Interconnected communities; reputation bridges | Trust within communities |
| **Public Network** | Phase 2+ | Open participation | Potential adversaries |

---

## Device Tiers

ISC adapts to device capability at startup. See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md#device-tiers) for the complete tier specification.

**Tiers:** High (desktop), Mid (mid-range phone), Low (budget phone), Minimal (constrained)

---

## Semantic Model

### Relation Ontology

A fixed set of 10 predefined relation tags ensures network-wide interoperability. See [SEMANTIC.md](SEMANTIC.md#relation-ontology) for the complete ontology.

**Tags:** `in_location`, `during_time`, `with_mood`, `under_domain`, `causes_effect`, `part_of`, `similar_to`, `opposed_to`, `requires`, `boosted_by`

### Compositional Embeddings

For each channel, distributions are computed locally. See [SEMANTIC.md](SEMANTIC.md#compositional-embeddings) for the complete implementation.

### Relational Matching

Matching uses bipartite alignment across the multi-vector hypergraph. See [SEMANTIC.md](SEMANTIC.md#relational-matching) for the complete specification.

### Model Version Negotiation

Embedding spaces from different models are not comparable. Every DHT entry includes:

```json
"model": "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 @sha256:abc123def456"
```

Clients silently filter candidates with unsupported models. The network self-partitions by model version without fully breaking.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Embedding** | `@xenova/transformers.js` (ONNX/WASM) |
| **P2P network** | `js-libp2p` (WebSockets + WebRTC, Noise, Yamux) |
| **DHT** | `@libp2p/kad-dht` |
| **ANN index** | `usearch` (WASM HNSW) |
| **Crypto** | Web Crypto API (ed25519) for signing, `libsodium-wrappers` for encryption (via `x25519` conversion) |
| **Storage** | localStorage + IndexedDB |
| **UI** | Vanilla HTML/JS (no framework dependencies) |

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why DHT + LSH?

- **Scalability**: O(log n) lookup without central index
- **Privacy**: Only vectors announced, not raw text
- **Censorship resistance**: No single point of failure

### Why Distributions Instead of Points?

- **Fuzzy identity**: Thoughts are inherently uncertain
- **Serendipity**: Overlapping distributions enable cross-topic discovery
- **Natural drift**: Editing a channel shifts the distribution smoothly

### Why Relational Embeddings?

- **Contextual binding**: "AI ethics in Neo-Tokyo during 2026" differs from "Neo-Tokyo AI ethics"
- **Compositional semantics**: Relations form a hypergraph, not flat vector space
- **Expressivity**: Full relational logic within browser constraints

### Why Browser-Only?

- **Privacy**: No server sees raw text or chat content
- **Censorship resistance**: No central infrastructure to shut down
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Bootstrap peers: 5-10 community-run libp2p relays (required)
  - STUN servers: Public (Google, Cloudflare) — free
  - TURN servers: Community-run (optional, for hard NATs)
  - Circuit relays: Community-run (optional, for fallback)
- **Server-Side Compute**: Minimal — only relay traffic, no application logic.
- **Cost**: ~$50-200/month for bootstrap peer bandwidth at 10k users.
- **Scale**: DHT provides O(log n) lookup; practical limits:
  - Browser memory: ~10k ANN index entries (HNSW)
  - WebRTC connections: ~50 concurrent per browser
  - Bootstrap bandwidth: Bottleneck at >100k concurrent users
  - **Mitigation**: Hierarchical DHT, community relays, federation (Phase 2+)

## Security & Safety

### Authenticity

- **User keypairs**: ed25519 generated via Web Crypto API on first launch
- **Signed announcements**: All DHT puts signed; recipients verify and discard invalid
- **Signed posts**: All social content tamperproof by design

### Safety Mechanisms (Trusted Network Mode)

| Mechanism | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Rate limiting** | DHT Announce: 5/min, Chat Dial: 20/hr, DHT Query: 30/min |
| **Mute/block** | Signed mute events stored in DHT; clients auto-filter |
| **Semantic filters** | Minimum 0.55 similarity threshold; per-channel controls |
| **Harassment exit** | Auto-decay when similarity drops; one-click mute |

### Privacy Guarantees

- No central servers; all data lives locally or traverses P2P
- Only vectors + peerID announced publicly; raw text never broadcast unless explicitly posted
- E2E encrypted chats via WebRTC DTLS
- Optional ephemeral keys per session/channel
- Optional Tor/I2P routing via community transport plugins

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation (Phase 1) | Mitigation (Phase 2+) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Malicious supernodes** | Local sanity checks + trusted selection | + Reputation weighting |
| **Sybil attackers** | Social trust barrier (invite-only) | + Reputation decay + uptime history |
| **Network eavesdroppers** | WebRTC DTLS + Noise protocol | Same |
| **Model poisoning** | Canonical model registry (DHT-hosted, signed) | Same |

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the complete threat model and security specification.

## Supernode Delegation

High-tier peers optionally act as **supernodes** to assist Low/Minimal-tier peers with computationally expensive operations. See [DELEGATION.md](DELEGATION.md) for the complete delegation protocol specification.

### Trust & Safety

- **No blind trust**: All delegated results cryptographically signed and locally verified
- **Reputation-weighted selection**: Peers prefer supernodes with high uptime
- **Privacy preserved**: Requests E2E encrypted; only channel descriptions delegated

---

## Social Network Layer

ISC's P2P and semantic foundations support a full decentralized social network:

### Posts & Feeds

- **Posts**: Embed text/media into the space, announce via LSH-hashed keys in DHT
- **For You feed**: Semantic proximity — ranked ANN queries surface nearby posts
- **Following feed**: Posts from explicitly followed peers
- **Explainability**: Every ranked post shows similarity score and matched channel

### Interactions

- **Likes**: Lightweight DHT announcements
- **Reposts**: Re-announce with your vector — shifts propagation toward your distribution
- **Replies**: Threaded WebRTC streams or DHT-linked posts
- **Quotes**: Embed original + commentary as fused vector

### Profiles & Follows

- **Profile**: Aggregated message of peer's channel distributions (bio as mean vector)
- **Follow**: Subscribe via libp2p pubsub
- **Suggested follows**: Ranked by ANN queries on your active channels

### Communities

- **Shared channels**: Groups co-edit a channel's mean/spread, creating semantic neighborhoods
- **Audio Spaces**: Mesh broadcast within dense channel clusters
- **DMs**: 1:1 or group WebRTC streams, E2E encrypted

See [SOCIAL.md](SOCIAL.md) for the complete social layer specification.
